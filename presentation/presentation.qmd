## Disclosures {#sec-disclosures}

- I have no disclosures or conflicts-of-interests related to this presentation

:::

## Motivation {#sec-motivation}

- When I began teaching, I underestimated difficulty of attendance
  - In setting attendance policies, I felt a tension
  - Noticed a wide array of policies
  - As students missed class, I dealt with more complex situations
  - My evening in-person class vs. asynch online class
  - Despite my success as a psychometrist, that didn't readily translate to
  rapport with students - but I did know the value
- Like any *researcher*, I started reading
  - But like any *instructor* could say $\rightarrow$ no one "right" way
  - Always an edge case that throws the best-laid plans
- My desire to uphold a high level of accessibility and access in my
course(s)
  - Still finding value and purpose in in-person classes
  - Sharing that purpose with my students

## Purpose / Learning Objectives {#sec-purpose}

- Frank, honest, and productive discussion on some strategies ...
  - ... and recognizing limits on said strategies
- Use as a starting point for changing departmental/course policies ...
  - ... or just individual instructor preferences
- Continued reflection on our styles, policies, and form to engage changing
expectations
- I'll start by highlighting the [Background and Starting Point] for
understanding attendance issues, and transition into [Working Towards
Solutions].

# Background and Starting Point {#sec-assume}

## Benefits of Attending {#sec-benefits}

**Being present in class is a *good* thing for students (and instructors)**

- Better course grades and overall GPA [@crede_class_2010]
- Evidence of relationship with instructor evaluation [@davidovitch_class_2006]
- Some activities or plans benefit from/require attendance
  - Especially many active learning activities!
- Less time-consuming to deal with re-hashing content
  - Professors are busy people! [@jacobs_overworked_2004]

## Complexity in Motivation to Attend {#sec-motivations}

**Student motivation and "choice" to attend is *complex***

- Not as simple as, "they just don't want to come / they are lazy"
  - Think about all the "excuses" you have heard, some surprising
- Student's individual traits and personality doesn't always explain attendance
[@van_blerkom_academic_1996]
- Student's primary motivation may relate to a utilitarian view of what they get
out of being present [@fjortoft_students_2005]
- Various mobility, safety, transportation issues

## Attendance Can Make or Break Relationships {#sec-make-or-break}

**Student's attendance situation, and instructors' reactions to those
circumstances, can *strain or strengthen* relationships**

- Student-faculty relationships already fraught with transactional issues
  - See flaws of student evaluations of faculty - [@langbein_management_2008]
- Want to be encouraging and inviting, while also being mindful of boundaries
[@owen_boundary_2007]
  - Asking for personal details may toe the reasonable line, for some
- Tension in wanting to be seen as warm, but not overly permissive or
authoritarian [@bassett_permissive_2013]
- Recognizing the potential positive academic and professional from cultivating
positive relationships [@ingraham_student-faculty_2018]

## "Attendance" and Access Doesn't Stop at the Door {#sec-att-and-access}

**Policies related to access to materials outside of class play a role too**

- Learning management systems (LMS) serve as vital storage tool for sharing
  - Do they help outcomes? Sometimes ... [@rubin_effect_2010]
  - Some faculty can find it difficult to embrace the learning curve
  [@gautreau_motivational_2011]
  - Students may not always *like* LMS [@horvat_student_2015], but are
  accustomed

- Instructors choose balance of *how much* to share exclusively in-class vs. how
much to share via the LMS
  - The actions (or sometimes inaction) we take can create a sort of implicit
  attendance policy
  - Is our course almost entirely shared online?, part of it?, very little?
  [@machajewski_patterns_2019]
  - We make additional decision on the *types* of materials to share or require,
    - May impact student perception and access; e.g., OER textbooks
    [@hilton_open_2016]

## Recap of Background {#sec-recap-of-back}

**So where does that all leave us? Confused? So was/am I**

- Clearly, having students in class is largely beneficial - but getting them
there isn't always easy
- Students sometimes miss for complicated reasons - how do we try to address
these things while not damaging our relationships?
- When students do miss, what do we provide on the LMS, and what do we
intentionally withhold (if anything at all)?

# Working Towards Solutions {#sec-solutions}

## Goals of These Solutions {#sec-goals-of-solutions}

**Encourage better in-class attendance (duh), while...**

- Addressing common scenarios/issues instructors face
- Accounting for circumstances outside of student control
- Promoting rapport between instructors and students
- Maintaining a high level of access to learning materials when possible

**It is *not* to completely de-value an in-person education!**

## Preemptive Limitations {#sec-limits}

**I'm not a miracle worker**

- Clearly, any solution to the myriad of nuances described before is going to be
complicated - this presentation won't solve all our woes!
- This process of revision and reflection will be long
- No one size fits all; tailor to your classes and skills
- Not all research on absences is likely to apply equal to college students
  - They have more independence than middle/high school students

## Overview of Common Issues {#sec-common-issues}

**Each of these will be addressed in the following sections**

- [Poor Class Attendance](sec-attend-prob)
- [Demonstrating Class Value](sec-demo-prob)
- [Dealing with "Excuses" with Absences](sec-excuses-prob)
- [Designing Flexible Content that Works Inside and Outside of Class](sec-flex-prob)
- [Embracing the LMS (and All of It's Problems)](sec-lms-woes-prob)

## Poor Class Attendance - The Problem {#sec-attend-prob}

**Simple - not enough students attending class regularly**

- As discussed in the [Background and Starting Point], there are many valid
reasons this may
happen, but it is still an issue
- While the following sections will deal with responding to poor attendance, we
still want to focus our attention on getting more students in-class each time
- Does having a "mandatory" attendance policy work? Is that all we need?

## Poor Class Attendance - A Starting Solution {#sec-attend-solution}

**Many strategies proposed in the literature**

- Unsurprisingly, I am not the first person interested in this area, a small
sample of empirical research:
  - @railsback_increasing_2004
  - @moore_does_2004
  - @al-shammari_enhancing_2016

- The first area to address is the mandatory attendance policy, where some
degree of absenteeism results in compounding and automatic grade deductions.
Success in various areas:
  - Pharmacy [@winkles_examination_2025]
  - Medicine [@subramaniam_attendance_2013]
  - Economics [@marburger_does_2006]
  - Problem solved, right? Well, somewhat; maybe works at the average level, but
  individuals may find it taxing

- In summary, it probably is wise to have *some* type of mandatory attendance
policy, but there are several ways we can supplement this suggestion...
  - Even if attendance isn't mandatory, you should still be taking it!

## Demonstrating Class Value - The Problem {#sec-demo-prob}

**The value of being in-person should be made apparent and explicit**

- Metaphor: "Why do we need to be here?" $\rightarrow$ "This meeting could have
been an email" - A feeling we all know too well
- Some, but not all students, have an intrinsic motivation to care about each
subject
- I've had students who, humbly, explain part of my class does not show this
value, because I've asked for feedback
  - This isn't *always* fair, be discerning in what advice to consider

## Demonstrating Class Value - A Starting Solution {#sec-demo-solution}

**Make the language clear**

- Try to make it clear what value a class provides when it meets in-person
instead of just being recorded
  - Don't assume students inherently recognize this!
- I write some reasons into the syllabus, e.g., easier to pay attention, ask
questions when confused, get clarification from peers/groups, get more
off-the-cuff examples for concepts
- Use with caution: make in-class activities worth points that cannot be made up
elsewhere
  - Some students see points as indicating value
- Similar, with caution: Clearly indicate how an activity plays into the larger
picture
  - E.g., "this will be on the exam/quiz"; "you need to do this same process for
  your paper"

## Dealing with "Excuses" - The Problem {#sec-excuses-prob}

**Instructors as an absolute arbiter in regard to absences? *Un-ideal***

- Opens up to bias in granting or rejecting
- Requires additional time (and cognitive load) for professors
- Incentivizes "convincing" or pleading the case

## Dealing with "Excuses" - A Starting Solution {#sec-excuses-solution}

**When possible, proactively set aside a "reasonable" numbers of absences
without penalty in regard to access or points**

- The exact extent of reasonable depends on the course
  - E.g., labs and practicals may have less than lectures
- Consider the theoretical point-of-no-return
- Consider the rough percentage of class that can be "made up" via materials on
the LMS
  - This will play into the next problem of [Designing Flexible
  Content](sec-flex-prob)
- Set concrete, explicit consequences for absences past the "reasonable" amount
  - Likely written in the syllabus, E.g., "After missing X classes you..."

## Designing Flexible Content - The Problem {#sec-flex-prob}

**When students miss, what do they stand to lose?**

- Interactive discussion, demonstrations, and many forms of active learning
may be especially hard to translate to out-of-class activity
- Are lecture slides, notes available or is it just "get notes from a friend"?
- Are practice activities done in class still effective at home?

## Designing Flexible Content - A Starting Solution {#sec-flex-solution}

**Within reason, ensure that content is *mostly* available via the LMS or other
methods (even the activities)**

- If not confidential, try to post slides and/or lecture notes prior to class
  - And make sure students know where to find them!
  - Consistency in formatting while [Embracing the LMS](sec-lms-woes-probs)
  can help
- Make sure activities are not just verbally administered in-class, but written
down somewhere for those who are online (may also help students who are
hard-of-hearing)
- If demonstrating something in the course, see if an alternative YouTube video
may be posted to the LMS that shows the same phenomenon or procedure
- When not possible to provide certain materials, try to explicitly and clearly
state why
  - E.g., "Exam answers are only available in-class or during office hours in
  order to protect the security of the test"

## Embracing the LMS - The Problem {#sec-lms-woes-prob}

**I'll be the first to admit: Blackboard can challenge me sometimes**

- It can be difficult to manage, move, copy, and edit a large amount of content
- Hopeful expectation for high accessibility scores can be difficult to meet
- Hard to speculate what will make the most sense for flow in student's eye
- More time in LMS means less time working on content and talking with students

## Embracing the LMS - A Starting Solution {#sec-lms-woes-solution}

**Spend time with the functions and settings in a sandbox; get feedback from
students**

- [GVSU's eLearning Team](https://www.gvsu.edu/elearn/) can set up template
courses to play around in prior to posting in the "real" course
- Use the "Student Preview" function regularly to check and make sure content
appear as expected
  - Try "roleplaying" as a student who missed class, is it intuitive to find
  relevant materials?
  - In that same vain, model using the LMS in class early on or briefly during
  each class period (or during recorded lectures)!
- Use a [Mid-semester Interview in Teaching
(MIT)](https://www.gvsu.edu/ftlc/mid-semester-student-feedback-29.htm) via Pew
FTLC or otherwise solicit feedback via survey on LMS structure BEFORE the end of
the semester
  - I've learned that many students greatly prefer a largely chronological flow,
  rather than categorization by type, i.e., less scrolling when completing work
  for the week
- Use hierarchy of learning modules and folders to stay organized

# Conclusion {#sec-conc}

- I've tried to give many anecdotal ideas and examples of what I see working
to make in-person classes more appealing and approachable to students
- Some of these ideas also help make the class more accessible when students
find themselves missing due to reasons outside of their control
  - Unfortunately, we are limited in the circumstances we can change
- At the core of many of these efforts is a sense of *grace*, showing some
leeway and trusting students to not take a mile
  - I understand why this is a difficult thing to always trust in
