	abstract = {A meta-analysis of the relationship between class attendance in college and college grades reveals that attendance has strong relationships with both class grades ( k = 69, N = 21,195, ρ = .44) and {GPA} ( k = 33, N = 9,243, ρ = .41). These relationships make class attendance a better predictor of college grades than any other known predictor of academic performance, including scores on standardized admissions tests such as the {SAT}, high school {GPA}, study habits, and study skills. Results also show that class attendance explains large amounts of unique variance in college grades because of its relative independence from {SAT} scores and high school {GPA} and weak relationship with student characteristics such as conscientiousness and motivation. Mandatory attendance policies appear to have a small positive impact on average grades ( k = 3, N = 1,421, d = .21). Implications for theoretical frameworks of student academic performance and educational policy are discussed.},

How do faculty members reconcile the demands of an academic career with the realities of family life? Drawing on a large national survey of postsecondary faculty conducted in 1998, the authors examine the length of the workweek by analyzing its relationship to faculty dissatisfaction with their workload. The authors find evidence that many professors are dissatisfied with their workload. Moreover, dissatisfaction increases among those working the longest hours. The data also indicate that very long hours on the job greatly contribute to research productivity. The very long hours demanded by faculty jobs thus pose a dilemma for parents who want to spend time with their children and their families. The authors conclude by suggesting that the challenge is to create a set of expectations for academic employment that are compatible with responsible parenting in dual-career couples.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The attendance mandate for the medical course in Melaka Manipal Medical College, Manipal, India was increased from 75\% to 90\% based on the assumption that the mandatory increase will improve the students' performance.
{AIMS}: To find out whether there is any correlation between class attendance and academic performance.
{SUBJECTS} {AND} {METHODS}: This was an institution based retrospective analytical study. Students who have completed Phase I (first two and a half years) of the {MBBS} course were included in the study. Student marks and attendance, from the database were obtained from three random batches, each, from two clusters A and B respectively. Those who had a mandatory attendance requirement of 75\% belonged to A (n = 243), and those who had a mandatory attendance percentage of 90\% belonged to B (n = 360). Statistical analyses performed included, Pearson 2 tailed correlation to correlate class attendance with student performance; Cluster analysis to classify group average in a similarity matrix; t-test to determine significance of difference in percentage of students who attained 100\% when the college changed mandatory attendance from 75\% to 90\%; Mann-Whitney test to find out if there was a better performance in university exam when attendance policy changed.
{RESULTS}: There was a significant correlation between attendance and the students who passed in the University exam. The number of students in the pass category was maximum ({\textgreater}90\%) compared to students in distinction and failed categories. Percentage of students with 100\% attendance rose from 4\% (n = 10) to 11\% (n = 40) when the mandatory attendance was increased from 75\% to 90\%.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Attendance policy correlated with better academic performance. Reducing absenteeism, probably contributed to the improved academic performance of the students. But the link between attendance and best and worst performances could not be predicted because of small numbers in every batch.},
